JSRhythm is a rhythm game that syncs to sheet music, aiming to make practicing rhythms fun and interesting! Enter in a rhythm in the form of sheet music, and a level is automatically generated to go along with the sheet music. There are also built-in levels to demonstrate the functionality and serve as examples. Future plans include a sight-reading mode and allowing the creation of levels based on embedded YouTube videos.
